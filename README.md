String are immutable

None is a placeholder value in Python

Tuples are immutable. Same as a list, except use () instead of [] to define it. So a tuple is an immutable list.

Can add 'pass' as placeholders in empty bodies.

Variables follow the LEGB rule, from L to B. The most specific rule gains priority:

L - Local within a function. Highest priority.

E - enclosing function locals, from inner to outer

G - global, names assigned at the top-level

B - built-in Python
